Kabotan is a web application built with Common Lisp that provides a hypermedia-driven API service with LLM integration. The backend uses Ningle to implement APIs that communicate with OpenAI-compatible endpoints and return HTML fragments. The frontend is built with HTMX following hypermedia-driven architecture principles, where the server generates HTML responses and the client uses declarative HTML attributes for interactions. This provides a lightweight, maintainable, and responsive user experience with minimal client-side JavaScript.
