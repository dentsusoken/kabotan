# Halloween Features (Archived)

**Note: This spec has been split into separate feature specs for better maintainability.**

## New Organization

This original combined spec has been reorganized into the following separate specs:

- **halloween-core**: Core infrastructure (LLM, language, utilities)
- **monster-diagnostic**: Monster personality diagnosis
- **story-generator**: Halloween story generation
- **character-chat**: Character-based conversations
- **trivia-bot**: Halloween trivia conversations
- **spell-generator**: Magical phrase generation

## Why Split?

The original spec contained multiple features in a single document, making it difficult to:
- Track progress on individual features
- Manage feature-specific requirements and design
- Develop and test features independently
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

## Migration Status

All content from this spec has been migrated to the new structure:
- Core infrastructure → `halloween-core/`
- Feature-specific content → Individual feature specs
- All tasks have been preserved with their completion status

## Reference

This directory is kept for historical reference. For active development, please refer to the individual feature specs listed above.
